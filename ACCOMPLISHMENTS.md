# RepDev Project Accomplishments

**Project:** RepDev - Reproducible Development Environments Made Simple  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete + Beyond ✅  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Repository:** [el-noir/repdev](https://github.com/el-noir/repdev)

---

## 🎯 Original Goal

### The Problem
- "It works on my machine!" - Inconsistent development environments
- Setting up new environments takes hours or days
- Different OS, dependencies, and configs across team members
- No simple, open-source CLI for full-stack environment reproduction

### The Vision
Create a CLI tool that makes it easy to define, share, and reproduce full-stack developer environments in one command.

**Goal:** `repdev up` - Start entire environment with one command

---

## 📊 Original MVP Scope (Phase 1)

### Planned Features:
1. ✅ Define environment in `repdev.yml`
2. ✅ `repdev init` - Create template
3. ✅ `repdev up` - Start environment
4. ✅ `repdev down` - Stop environment
5. ✅ Docker Compose integration
6. ✅ YAML parsing and validation
7. ✅ Basic logging and error handling

---

## 🎉 What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Core Features ✅ (100% Complete)

#### 1. **CLI Commands** ✅
Implemented **9 commands** (planned: 4):

| Command | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `init` | ✅ | Create template with interactive prompts |
| `up` | ✅ | Start containers with hooks & readiness |
| `down` | ✅ | Stop and remove containers |
| `status` | ✅ | Show container status with state tracking |
| `validate` | ✅ | Validate template against schema |
| `logs` | ✅ | View container logs with follow mode |
| `exec` | ✅ | Execute commands in containers |
| `restart` | ✅ | Restart containers individually or all |
| `doctor` | ✅ | System health checks & diagnostics |

**Exceeded Goal:** 9 commands delivered vs 4 planned (+125%)

#### 2. **Lifecycle Hooks** ✅
**Not in original MVP - Bonus Feature!**

Global hooks:
```yaml
hooks:
  preUp: ["echo Starting..."]
  postUp: ["echo Ready!"]
  preDown: ["echo Stopping..."]
  postDown: ["echo Stopped"]
```

Per-service hooks:
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    hooks:
      beforeStart: ["npm install"]
      afterStart: ["npm run migrate"]
```

**Impact:** Enables custom initialization and automation per project

#### 3. **Readiness Checks (wait_for)** ✅
**Not in original MVP - Bonus Feature!**

Three types implemented:
- HTTP endpoint checking
- TCP port connectivity
- Container health status

```yaml
wait_for:
  type: http
  url: http://localhost:3000/health
  timeout: 60000
  retries: 30
  interval: 2000
```

**Impact:** Ensures services are truly ready before proceeding

#### 4. **Interactive Prompts** ✅
**Enhanced beyond MVP!**

- Preset selection menu when running `repdev up`
- Customization prompts for `repdev init`
- Asks for directories, ports, package managers
- Guided setup reduces friction

**Impact:** New developers productive in minutes vs hours

#### 5. **Environment File Support (env_file)** ✅
**Not in original MVP - Bonus Feature!**

```yaml
services:
  app:
    env_file:
      - .env
      - .env.local
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development  # Overrides .env
```

Features:
- Standard `.env` file parsing
- Multiple file support
- Priority-based merging
- Security best practices

**Impact:** Keep secrets out of version control

#### 6. **Network Configuration** ✅
**Enhanced beyond MVP - Full Docker Networking Support!** (Added Oct 21, 2025)

**Network Modes:**
```yaml
services:
  app:
    network_mode: host    # High performance
    # OR bridge, none, service:name, container:id
```

**Custom Networks with Isolation:**
```yaml
networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
      config:
        - subnet: 172.25.0.0/16
          gateway: 172.25.0.1

services:
  web:
    networks: [frontend]
  api:
    networks: [frontend, backend]  # Bridge between tiers
  db:
    networks: [backend]  # Isolated from frontend
```

**Advanced Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  api:
    networks:
      backend:
        ipv4_address: 172.25.0.10
        aliases: [api-server, backend-api]
```

- Custom networks with drivers (bridge, overlay, host, macvlan)
- IPAM configuration (subnet, gateway)
- Static IP assignment
- Network aliases for service discovery
- External network support
- Multi-tier architecture patterns
- Network isolation for security

**Impact:**
