🧠 The Problem

Every developer has experienced this:

“It works on my machine!”

When multiple developers work on the same project:

Their systems have different OS, dependencies, and configs.

Setting up a new environment takes hours or days.

Bugs appear that are not reproducible on other systems.

Tools like Docker, Codespaces, and Gitpod try to solve this,
but:

Docker is too low-level and not developer-friendly for newcomers.

Codespaces/Gitpod are cloud-only or paid.

There's no open-source, simple CLI tool that can define and reproduce full-stack environments in one command.

💡 The Solution — RepDev CLI

RepDev is a command-line tool that makes it easy to define, share, and reproduce full-stack developer environments — both locally and remotely.

Think of it as:

“docker-compose + nvm + npm install + VSCode config + db setup — all automated by one YAML file.”

⚙️ What It Does (MVP Scope)

Here’s what the MVP (Phase 1) does:

1️⃣ Define the environment

A developer defines their environment in a repdev.yml file:

project: ai-api
services:
  web:
    image: node:20
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    command: "npm run dev"
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb


This YAML describes:

What containers (services) are needed

What dependencies/commands to run

Any environment variables or ports

2️⃣ Initialize (repdev init)

Creates a repdev.yml template in the project directory, pre-filled with example configs.

3️⃣ Spin up environment (repdev up)

Reads repdev.yml, converts it to a docker-compose.yml (or uses it directly), and runs:

docker-compose up -d


→ Launches containers, sets up network, and bootstraps the project automatically.

4️⃣ Tear down (repdev down)

Runs:

docker-compose down


→ Stops all services and cleans up resources.

🧠 Under the Hood (How It Works)

CLI Layer (Node.js + Commander.js)

Handles commands like repdev init, repdev up, repdev down.

Reads YAML config and translates to Docker/Podman commands.

Configuration Layer (YAML Parser)

Parses repdev.yml and validates schema (services, environment vars, etc.)

Executor Layer (Docker Runtime)

Invokes Docker Compose commands using Node’s child_process.exec.

Template Engine (optional later)

Can generate prebuilt templates for React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, etc.

🎯 CURRENT PHASE: POST-MVP / PRE-LAUNCH

Next Immediate Steps:

1. 🧪 Cross-platform Testing
   - [ ] Test on macOS
   - [ ] Test on Linux
   - [ ] Verify all commands work across platforms

2. 🤖 Automated Testing
   - [ ] Setup Jest or Mocha
   - [ ] Unit tests for core modules
   - [ ] Integration tests for CLI commands
   - [ ] Target: 80%+ coverage

3. 📦 npm Publication
   - [ ] Verify package.json metadata
   - [ ] Test installation flow
   - [ ] Publish to npm registry
   - [ ] Setup GitHub releases

4. 📢 Launch Preparation
   - [ ] Create demo video
   - [ ] Write blog post
   - [ ] Prepare social media posts
   - [ ] Setup GitHub Pages (optional)

5. 📊 Monitoring & Feedback
   - [ ] Setup GitHub Issues templates
   - [ ] Monitor npm downloads
   - [ ] Collect user feedback
   - [ ] Prioritize feature requests

� Future Automation Ideas (Phase 2+)

Once launched and stable, we can extend automation capabilities:

Feature	Status	Priority	Description
AI setup assistant	⏳ Future	Medium	LLM-based helper that reads repo and auto-generates repdev.yml.
Binary compilation	⏳ Future	High	Use pkg to create standalone binaries (remove Node.js dependency)
IDE integration	⏳ Future	High	VSCode or WebStorm plugin to start/stop environments with one click.
Variable interpolation	⏳ Future	Medium	Support ${VAR} syntax in templates
Environment profiles	⏳ Future	Medium	dev/test/prod configurations
Auto-detection	⏳ Future	Medium	Detect project type and suggest templates
Template marketplace	⏳ Future	Low	Share and discover community templates
Environment syncing	⏳ Future	Low	Sync .env, ports, and configs between teammates automatically.
Snapshot system	⏳ Future	Medium	Save & restore exact state of running containers (for debugging).
Workflow orchestration	⏳ Future	Low	Integrate LangGraph/LangChain for automated workflows
Remote mode	⏳ Future	Medium	Launch environments in cloud VM or container registry via SSH.
🏗️ MVP Goal Summary (COMPLETED ✅)

Original Goal:
Make a local, reproducible development environment that anyone can start with one command:

repdev up ✅ DELIVERED


Original MVP Deliverables:

✅ CLI tool (repdev) - 9 commands delivered vs 4 planned
✅ Basic YAML parser - Enhanced with JSON Schema validation
✅ Docker Compose runner - Full Docker API integration
✅ Commands: init, up, down - PLUS: status, validate, logs, exec, restart, doctor
✅ Simple logs and error handling - Enhanced with pattern recognition and suggestions

BONUS FEATURES DELIVERED (Not in original MVP):

✅ Lifecycle hooks (preUp/postUp/preDown/postDown + per-service)
✅ Readiness checks (HTTP, TCP, container health)
✅ Interactive prompts (preset selection, customization)
✅ env_file support (.env file loading with priority)
✅ Network support (host/bridge/none + custom networks)
✅ Pre-built presets (MERN, Django, Django DRF, Next.js, Basic Node)
✅ State tracking (.repdev/state.json)
✅ Health diagnostics (repdev doctor)
✅ Enhanced error handling (10+ error patterns)
✅ Professional documentation (4 comprehensive guides)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧭 Why RepDev is Unique (What Was Delivered)

Unlike Docker Compose, which only defines containers,
RepDev provides the COMPLETE developer experience:

✅ Container orchestration (like Docker Compose)
✅ Lifecycle automation (hooks at every stage)
✅ Readiness verification (HTTP, TCP, health checks)
✅ Interactive setup (guided prompts, no manual YAML editing)
✅ Pre-built templates (5 production-ready stacks)
✅ Smart error handling (actionable suggestions for 10+ error types)
✅ State management (track what's running, detect conflicts)
✅ Health diagnostics (repdev doctor checks everything)
✅ DX enhancements (logs, exec, restart without raw Docker)
✅ Security built-in (env_file support, keep secrets out of git)

It's like having:

    npm install + docker-compose up + setup.sh + error handling + 
    readiness checks + state tracking + health monitoring + 
    interactive prompts + documentation

all handled by one declarative YAML.
