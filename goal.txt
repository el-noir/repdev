🧩 The Core Idea — “Reproducible Dev Environments” (aka RepDev)
🧠 The Problem

Every developer has experienced this:

“It works on my machine!”

When multiple developers work on the same project:

Their systems have different OS, dependencies, and configs.

Setting up a new environment takes hours or days.

Bugs appear that are not reproducible on other systems.

Tools like Docker, Codespaces, and Gitpod try to solve this,
but:

Docker is too low-level and not developer-friendly for newcomers.

Codespaces/Gitpod are cloud-only or paid.

There's no open-source, simple CLI tool that can define and reproduce full-stack environments in one command.

💡 The Solution — RepDev CLI

RepDev is a command-line tool that makes it easy to define, share, and reproduce full-stack developer environments — both locally and remotely.

Think of it as:

“docker-compose + nvm + npm install + VSCode config + db setup — all automated by one YAML file.”

⚙️ What It Does (MVP Scope)

Here’s what the MVP (Phase 1) does:

1️⃣ Define the environment

A developer defines their environment in a repdev.yml file:

project: ai-api
services:
  web:
    image: node:20
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    command: "npm run dev"
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb


This YAML describes:

What containers (services) are needed

What dependencies/commands to run

Any environment variables or ports

2️⃣ Initialize (repdev init)

Creates a repdev.yml template in the project directory, pre-filled with example configs.

3️⃣ Spin up environment (repdev up)

Reads repdev.yml, converts it to a docker-compose.yml (or uses it directly), and runs:

docker-compose up -d


→ Launches containers, sets up network, and bootstraps the project automatically.

4️⃣ Tear down (repdev down)

Runs:

docker-compose down


→ Stops all services and cleans up resources.

🧠 Under the Hood (How It Works)

CLI Layer (Node.js + Commander.js)

Handles commands like repdev init, repdev up, repdev down.

Reads YAML config and translates to Docker/Podman commands.

Configuration Layer (YAML Parser)

Parses repdev.yml and validates schema (services, environment vars, etc.)

Executor Layer (Docker Runtime)

Invokes Docker Compose commands using Node’s child_process.exec.

Template Engine (optional later)

Can generate prebuilt templates for React, NestJS, PostgreSQL, etc.

🔁 Future Automation Ideas

Once MVP works, we can extend automation capabilities:

Feature	Description
AI setup assistant	LLM-based helper that reads repo and auto-generates repdev.yml.
Environment syncing	Sync .env, ports, and configs between teammates automatically.
IDE integration	VSCode or WebStorm plugin to start/stop environments with one click.
Snapshot system	Save & restore exact state of running containers (for debugging).
Workflow orchestration	Integrate LangGraph/LangChain to handle automated workflows like “start frontend → wait for API → seed DB”.
Remote mode	Launch environments in a cloud VM or container registry via SSH.
🏗️ MVP Goal Summary

Goal:
Make a local, reproducible development environment that anyone can start with one command:

repdev up


MVP Deliverables:

CLI tool (repdev)

Basic YAML parser

Docker Compose runner

Commands: init, up, down

Simple logs and error handling

🧭 Why It’s Unique

Unlike Docker Compose, which only defines containers,
RepDev defines the entire developer setup —
runtime versions, dependencies, environment variables, and project-specific configurations.

It’s like having:

npm install + docker-compose up + setup.sh


all handled by one declarative YAML.
